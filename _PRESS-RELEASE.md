There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## ReInvent ##
  > An inventory app that syncs online and offline sales for business owners using Shopify as an online storefront.

## Summary ##
  > ReInvent allows businesses to easily track the quantities of products they have available for sale. Any orders made through your Shopify store will be reflected in ReInvent. Inversely, any updates to product info made in ReInvent will be reflected in your Shopify store!

## Problem ##
  > Shopify does a great job of maintaining inventory as people make online orders; however, many businesses make sales from other origins as well, be it from physical storefronts, trade shows, or wholesale deals. This requires owners to constantly input Shopify order info manually into any centralized records they keep. This can also cause race conditions for the quantity of product available for sale on Shopify, meaning a customer on the Shopify store may order a product that has already been sold out due to offline sales.

## Solution ##
  > ReInvent unifies all stock and order information in one place, providing a great convenience for shop owners. Any sales made, no matter the origin, will cause the changes in inventory to be updated across the board.

## Quote from You ##
  > "ReInvent provides a great service to businesses that rely on making sales to both online and offline shoppers."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Getting started is as easy as providing ReInvent with your Shopify account information and your current inventory details.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "ReInvent is easy to use and takes the headache out of making sure all of my product info is matching in different places. I would say any small business that provides goods in limited supply MUST look into using ReInvent."
